Earlier in project 1, the bot was being run locally. Moving to the cloud gives several advantages like Availability, Fault tolerance and auto scaling. Our application is hosted on digital ocean that will give all the advantages of the cloud whereas project1 did not. Additonally, now the database size is not limited by the local machine's SSD size. Cloud gives the flexibility on databse size and it can auto scale based on load.                                                                                                                                                     |
