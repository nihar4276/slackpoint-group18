### How the Hell do you use this?

List of miracles that slackpoint can performâœ¨:

* Create a new task
* Mark task as done
* View pending tasks
* View completed tasks
* Check the leaderboard to see who's winning!
* Edit an existing task
* Get a daily summary delivered to you. Or view it when you want!
* Get reminders for tasks nearing their deadline
* Ask for help

lets go over these one by one...

#### **1. Create new task:**

You can create a new task by simple using the ``/create-task`` command. We ask for just a few more parameters in addition to that:

Command: ``/create``

![Create Task GIF](https://i.imgur.com/lUtX23a.gif)

This particular command will create a new task with the description as ``Hey! This is my new task`` having ``100`` points and a deadline of ``15th October 2022``

#### **2. Mark task as done:**

Here you can mark a task as completed. You just need to give the task ID as a parameter

Command: ``/task-done [task ID]``

Example:
``/task-done 10214``

![Task Done GIF](https://i.imgur.com/gOB6dVs.gif)

This will mark the task having task ID ``10214`` as completed. Further, updates records to show that this task is completed by user who posted this command

#### **3. View pending tasks:**

This command will return the list of incomplete tasks. Relax! no parameters required here

Command: ``/viewpending [no parameters]``

![View pending GIF](https://i.imgur.com/TAnNoSO.gif)

Above command will display a list of pending tasks

#### **4. View completed tasks:**

Like the above command this will return a list of completed tasks. No parameters here as well!

Command: ``/viewcompleted [no parameter]``

![View completed GIF](https://i.imgur.com/3SFQU2N.gif)

Above command will display a list of completed tasks

#### **5. Leaderboard:**

Want to get competitive? Take a peek at the leaderboard and try to beat the winner!

Command: ``/leaderboard [no parameters]``

![Leaderboard GIF](https://i.imgur.com/LNfVFHX.gif)

It displays the list of the top performers on the channel along with their points.

#### **6. Edit a task:**

Made a mistake while adding a task? No problem! 
Edit the task with values pre-populated as you had entered before. 

Command: ``/edit-task [task ID]``

![Edit GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21088141/205816733-2bf10e44-baae-45d1-91f3-9a92d8123041.gif)


This particular command will edit your existing task with the description as ``Hey! This is my edited task`` having ``4`` points and a deadline of ``15th December 2022``

#### **7. Summary:**

Got too many tasks? Can't keep track of everything?
Now use the summary command to get a summarized version of all tasks and the leaderboard!
What's better? You get it delivered to your message box automatically every day!

Command: ``/summary [no parameters]``

![Summary GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21088141/205815864-733197f6-cf83-4117-9118-bce0341c0533.gif)


This command will display a list of pending tasks, completed tasks, and the leaderboard. 


#### **8. Reminder:**

"Am I expected to remember all my tasks with their deadlines?" Well, not anymore!
Get reminders delivered to you a day before tasks are due, so you don't have to munch on almonds all the time. 

![Reminder GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21088141/205815714-a42f1d3a-4bba-4407-9c2a-e8122071fb7c.gif)

This command will display a list of pending tasks due the next day. 

#### **9. Help:**

Newbie at using slackpoint? You could use some help...

Command: ``/help [no parameters]``

![Help GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21088141/205815812-8144bef2-73df-438c-a84a-6e322a09625a.gif)


This will provide you will all the available commands and how to use them. Same sh*t this section is doing.

## Project documentation
The `docs` folder incorporates all necessary documents and documentation in our project.

## Tools used
Code formatter: black and flake8

Tech stack: Flask, PostgreSQL
 
## ðŸ“– Getting started:

  - ### Prerequisite:
      - Download [Python3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
      - Download [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/).
      - Download [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
      - Download [Pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)

   ## Run Locally

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
  python3.x -m venv test_env
```

Activate the virtual environment:
Linux/MacOS:
```bash
  source test_env/bin/activate
```
Windows:
```bash
  ./test_env/Scripts/activate
```

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nihar4276/slackpoint-v2.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Slackpoint
```

Install dependencies

```bash 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Log on to api.slack.com and create your own slack bot.

On ngrok shell run 'ngrok http 5000' to get the public IP address in your local machine. 

Add all the /commands in the bot configuration and paste the url from ngrok shell to requesting url section in the bot configuration.

Finally, change the URL in interactivity and shortcuts, URL: <BaseURL>/slack/interactive-endpoint. 

Start the server

```bash
  flask run
```

     - Site will be hosted at:
       `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` 
       
Before creating the database, 

(1) Create a database in PgAdmin with any name convention.
  
(2) Change the local path of PostgreSQL in .env file (DATABASE_URL= 'postgresql://postgres:(password)@localhost/(database name from PgAdmin') 
  
(3) Provide the Slack sigining secret and Slack bot token from the bot you created. 

To create tables in the database,
```bash
First run the command 'flask shell'
Next command to create the database - 'db.create_all()'
```
 
### Project Dependencies

* flask
* slackclient
* python-dotenv
* slackeventsapi
* flask-sqlalchemy
* psycopg2
* pytest
* pytest-mock
* black
